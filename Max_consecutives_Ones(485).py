Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

code:
class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        max_count = 0 
        for i in nums:
            if i == 1:
                count += 1
                max_count = max(max_count,count)
            else:
                count = 0
        return max_count
