# Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible.

# You can use each character in text at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.
# Example 1:
# Input: text = "nlaebolko"
# Output: 1
# Example 2:

# Input: text = "loonbalxballpoon"
# Output: 2
# Example 3:

# Input: text = "leetcode"
# Output: 0

# Constraints:

# 1 <= text.length <= 104
# text consists of lower case English letters only.

class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        b = text.count('b')
        a = text.count('a')
        l = text.count('l')
        o = text.count('o')
        n = text.count('n')
        return min(b,a,l//2,o//2,n)
